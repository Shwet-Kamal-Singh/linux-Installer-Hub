- Ensure your system meets the requirements for each tool you're installing.
- Wireshark may require additional configuration to allow non-root users to capture packets.
- OpenSSH Server installation will enable the SSH service. Make sure to configure it properly for security.
- Nmap and Wireshark are powerful tools. Ensure you have permission before scanning networks you don't own or manage.
