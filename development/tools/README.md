## Notes

- These scripts require sudo privileges to install packages and modify system settings.
- Git is often pre-installed on many Linux distributions. The script will update it if it's already present.
- Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code are proprietary software, although VS Code has an open-source version called VSCodium.
- The installation scripts for Sublime Text and VS Code will add the necessary repositories to your system for future updates.
- After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or log out and back in for all changes to take effect.


## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided as-is, without warranty. Review before running, especially those requiring sudo privileges.
