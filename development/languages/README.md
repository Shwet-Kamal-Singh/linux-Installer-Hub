## Notes

- These scripts require sudo privileges to install packages and modify system settings.
- Ensure your system meets the requirements for each language or SDK you're installing.
- Some languages may already be installed on your system. The scripts will update them if they're already present.
- For languages like Java, you may be prompted to choose between different versions (e.g., OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK).
- Flutter installation requires Dart, which will be installed automatically if not present.
- .NET Core and Mono installations may conflict. It's recommended to choose one based on your development needs.



## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided as-is, without warranty. Review before running, especially those requiring sudo privileges.
